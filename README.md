# Home Automation Web Application

This project was originally based on angular-seed project [https://github.com/angular/angular-seed]. Later on a maven webapp was created and the main contents of the original angular-seed project moved to match the maven structure and avoid using bower and all other node.js specific packages. The main aim of this webapp is to:

* Learn node.js and angular js in particular
* Play with Rapsberry Pi at home and control it via P4J
* Wire up the 2 above together (to have a angular js webapp run on a J2EE server leveraging P4J to talk to GPIO pins of RPi)
* Prepare a home automation using several sensors and relays for our new to be build house

## Technologies

* J2EE
* P4J
* Maven
* Restfull WS in Java (Jersey and Jackson for JSON)
* Angular JS
